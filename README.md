# Laser-Ethernet

In this repo I will track the progress of my laser ethernet project. The goal is to design and build a device, that
transmits ethernet frames over a laser.

## first try

I tried to connect 2 Raspberry PIs via serial connection using pppd (see sources). Then I replaced the wired connection
with a simple laser transceiver. Transmission speed was ~10-20 kBit/s.
ToDo: Add schematics
